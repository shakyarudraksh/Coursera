                <h2>Isaac Newton</h2>
                <p>
                    Co-inventor of calculus, a major contributor to the science of optics and a gifted mathematician, Isaac Newton (1643-1727), who was born in Lincolnshire, outlined the laws of mechanics that now underpin vast swaths of classical physics. Most important of all, Newton outlined the principle of gravity, which explained how the planets revolve round the sun. During his life, he was showered with honours, including the presidency of the Royal Society. He is renowned as a supreme rationalist, though he actually wrote more about alchemy and religion.

                <h2>Niels Bohr</h2>
                <p>
                    Born in Copenhagen, Bohr (1885-1962) developed the modern idea of an atom, which has a nucleus at the centre with electrons revolving round it. When electrons move from one energy level to another, they emit discrete quanta of energy. The work won Bohr a Nobel prize in 1922. For his achievements, Carlsberg brewery gave Bohr a special gift: a house with a pipeline connected to its brewery next door, thus providing him with free beer for life. In 1954, Bohr helped establish Cern, the European particle physics facility. In 1975, his son, Aage, won a Nobel for research on atomic nuclei.

                <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
                <p>
                    Three great theories define our physical knowledge of the universe: relativity, quantum mechanics and gravitation. The first is the handiwork of German-born Albert Einstein (1879-1955), who remains the physicist with the greatest reputation for originality of thought. His work showed that space and time are not immutable but are fluid and malleable. Einstein, who took US citizenship in 1940, also provided the world with its most famous equation, E=mc2, which demonstrates the equivalence of mass and energy. He was awarded the 1921 Nobel prize for physics.
